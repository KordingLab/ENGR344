        "\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are methods that build or train models to fit to sample data with the purpose of using the models for prediction or decision making. These algorithms usually use optimization techniques to fit the model to data. There are many different approaches to ML. You may have heard of some of them: support vector machines, random forests, logistic regression, etc. Many machine learning courses teach them. We argue that, unless you want to do research in that area, that there is a better solution for getting problems solved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Automated Machine Learning (Auto ML) provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning automatic. The promise is to allow better results in Machine Learning tasks, to accelerate research on Machine Learning, and to make state of the art machie learning methods available to everyone. Importantly, Auto ML will avoid making the mistakes that many humans make.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Models in machine learning are defined by the model type (e.g. support vector machinem or logistic regression) and their settings that are higher-level parameters (e.g. regularization strength). These parameters are also called  \"hyperparameters.\" Traditionally, models that are effective predictors of the data are found using intuitions, trial, and error - in other words the hyperparameters are hand-tuned. In practice, the choice of algorithm and parameters are hard for humans to guess and hence trial and error usually wins. But why should we let humans do the boring task of trying algorithms until things work?\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, AutoML often involves the use of hyperparameter optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian Optimization, to efficiently navigate the space of possible models and model configurations and quickly discover what works well for a given predictive modeling task. It allows non-expert machine learning practitioners to quickly and easily discover what works well or even best for a given dataset with very little technical background or direct input. There are many platforms available to perform AutoML: Google Cloud AutoML, Amazon, Azure, Auto-SKlearn, and other. We will be using Auto-SKlearn in our tutorial. \n",
        "\n",
        "The big advantage of AutoML though is that it avoids leakage. When we try 10 algorithms and deploy the best, we will do better than chance, even if the data is entirely random. But AutoML naturally avoids this problem. As such, the results of AutoML are not just better (because AutoML tries more ideas than Konrad would). They are also more trustworthy (because AutoML does not inappropriately use test set information while humans do.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **What is Auto-Sklearn?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Auto-Sklearn is an open-source library for performing AutoML in Python. It makes use of the popular Scikit-Learn machine learning library for data transforms and machine learning algorithms and uses a Bayesian Optimization search procedure to efficiently discover a top-performing model pipeline for a given dataset. \n",
        "\n",
        "Auto-Sklearn has won many auto-ML competitions. It includes a lot of cool tricks. But all of these tricks are usually irrelevant from a practitioners perspective. We usually just want good results. And we want that these good results still work on a new dataset. As an example of a cool trick, Auto-Sklearn uses insights from previous ML problems it solved to allow it to basically try good ideas based on the data. E.g. if there are very few data points and the problem is very high dimensional it will use more linear techniques than if things are the other way around."

        "\n",
        "- $f(x) = 0.27$, at the top of the plot: this is our model's prediction for the first test set example. This means that our autoML model gives this patient a 27\\% chance of having heart disease.\n",
        "- $E[f(x)] = 0.591$, at the bottom of the plot: this is the *average* prediction of our model on the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember from the slides how we talked about the **marginal contribution** of a feature as its importance? Here, we make it more concrete in that the Shapley value tells us how a particular feature makes our model deviate from the **average** prediction, $E[f(x)]$. \n",
        "\n",
        "What's neat about Shapley values is that since they are computed over all combinations of features, the sum of the Shapley values for each individual feature plus $E[f(x)]$ will exactly equal the prediction the model makes for the example! \n",
        "\n",
        "**Exercise:** Convince yourself that the sum of the Shapley values plus the average prediction equals the percentage chance of the prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, we can look at the features themselves. For this example, it appears that the feature \"cp = 0\" has the biggest influence on the model output, as it reduces the model's prediction probability by **0.13**, followed by \"ca = 2\" and \"exang = 1\" which both reduce the model's prediction probability by **0.08**.\n",
        "\n",

        "This suggests that that \"cp = 0,\" according to our model, reduces the probability of heart disease. We aren't doctors, so we need domain expertise to determine whether this is sensible or not. \"Angina\" is constriction of blood vessels in the heart, which doesn't sound ideal, but according to domain experts, \"typical\" angina (cp = 0) is preferable in patients with heart problems as opposed \"atypical\" angina (cp = 1). \"Typical\" angina is predictable (triggered by stress and exercise) and responds to treatment, which are both signals that the condition affecting the patient may not be an underlying heart disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can also look at how \"ca\" aligns with medical knowledge. A flouroscopy is a test that checks the blockages of major blood vessels: more vessels colored means there are less blockages, so higher values mean lower risk for heart disease. The patient has a value of \"ca = 2,\" which is the second highest possible value, and the SHAP value appropriately indicates that this lowers the predicted risk for heart disease. "

        "- We prepared our data for use in the auto-sklearn coding library\n",
        "- We gave a limited amount of time for auto-sklearn to choose the best model for fitting a classifier to our data\n",
        "- We also visualized the prediction performance of our classifier by looking at accuracy scores and making a confusion matrix\n",
